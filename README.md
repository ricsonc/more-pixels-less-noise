# more-pixels-less-noise

Here is a small crop of a larger image taken in relatively low light. There is a lot of noise in the above image. However, I actually took 12 images in rapid succession and fused them together to create the bottom image. No tripod was used, and I allowed my hands to shake more than usual while taking the photographs. The bottom photograph is actually twice the resolution (80 MP) and most of the noise has been removed.
