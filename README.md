# more-pixels-less-noise

Below is a small crop of a larger image taken in relatively low light. There is a lot of noise in the above image. The top image is just the first of 12 which I took fused together to create the bottom image, which is twice the resolution (80 MP) and much cleaner. No tripod was used, and I deliberately shook my hands more than usual while taking the photographs.
